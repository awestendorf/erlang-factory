Algorithms
  * supervised (Old)
    * backpropagation
  * unsupervised (The Future)
    * kohonan map
    * adaptive resonance theory
    * Hebbian
    * Modulated
    * Evolutionary

Topology and Weight Evolving NN
  * Population and fitness functions
  * parametric mutation operators
  * topological mutation operators
  * other mutation operators (learning algorithms, activation functions, submodules)

Neurons can be encoded as tuples
  {neuron, InputPids, OutputPids, State .... }

Supervision trees and OTP to represent neurons

TODO: read about digraphs in erlang

preprints available on arxiv.org
code coming to github soon (what account? don't know)
