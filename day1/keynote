Lots of growth in Erlang conferences
Lots of new patches to erlang/otp on github

Dialyzer
========
Static analysis to identify discrepancies
 * type errors
 * api violations
 * unreachable code
 * opacity violations
 * concurrency errors and race conditions (-Wrace_conditions)

Experimental support for message passing problems and deadlocks
Need to recompile with +debug_info
  erlc +debug_info -o ebin src/*.erl
  dialyzer ebin

use --add_to_plt for apps to include in the test suite

See http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/dialyzer/ for continuous integration


Expose type information for fun and profit
  * add explicit guards
    * may have small runtime overhead
  * add type delarations and function specs
    * can be used by dialyzer

The -spec declarations are turned into edoc @spec annotations

-type filename() :: string().
-spec foo(FileName :: filename()) -> [{ok, Success}, {error, Reason}].

Can also do the above and refer to a type declared elsewhere

dialyzer -Wunderspecs tells us if -spec are underspecified
Add -spec for all exported functions


TypEr
=====
A type annotator
Displays function specs which already exist or are inferred by dializer

typer --show-exported foo.erl

Requires dialyzer to have generated plt file

Can add types to record fields

-record( foo, {
  bar :: string() %% a string
}).


Tidier
======
Automatic refactoring tool

All transformations are conservative
 * use newer constructs
 * smaller code
 * redundancy elimination
 * performance improvement

Tidier has a website where you can upload code and get the results
Not available as a local tool, only the web. Has licensing for closed source projects
tidier.softlab.ntua.gr

Tidier is awesome

PropEr
======
Inspired by QuickCheck
Property-based testing tool

CED
===
Concurrency Error Detector

detects some concurrency errors
Available on github https://github.com/mariachris/CED
