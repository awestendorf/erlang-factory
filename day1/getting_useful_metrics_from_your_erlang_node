Works for Voalte, real-time messages for nurses

https://github.com/justinkirby/emetric

inspired by rebar and eper

wants it to be used by non-developers and non-erlang users (i.e. sys admins)
wants to be part of CI

pluggable
 * add new data sources
 * add new output formats (e.g. munin)



tsung needs maxusers on <client> greater than man number of users altogether
example tsung config uses all custom stanzas, we'll have to do the same it seems

plotr is a tool to graph data for fun and profit. He ran a python script, but the web
says plotr is javascript. Figure that out.

Uses code injection to test so there's some concern about monitoring. emetric
may not be correct out of the box, but could serve as a template for writing
a module to output ejabberd data to munin

Findings:
 * do not store mnesia tables in memory, but disc_only_copies is slow
 * ejabberd global shared rosters are bad
